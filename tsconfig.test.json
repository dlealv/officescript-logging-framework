// This configuration extends the base tsconfig.json for local testing.
// - "extends" imports all settings from tsconfig.json, but any property listed here overrides the base.
// - The "include" array here replaces (does NOT merge with) the one in the base config.
//     * This allows you to include test, mocks, and wrappers folders for test runs without affecting production builds.
//     * Also includes "types/**/*.d.ts" to ensure all custom and Office Scripts type definitions are available during tests.
// - "compilerOptions" may override or add to those in the base config.
